## Description
In this project I took an existing webpage and refactored the html and css code to be more semantic and efficient without changing the final appearance. This included updating div tags to semantic elements, adding descriptive text to the title tag and image alt attributes , as well as fixing broken links. I cleaned up the css by consolidating classes (making ids when needed to allow for future specifics) and grouping relevant styles. The result is a webpage that is both easier to work on as a developer and better optimized for search engines.
