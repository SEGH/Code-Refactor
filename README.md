# Code-Refactor
In this project I took an existing webpage and refactored the html and css code to be more semantic and efficient without changing the final appearance. This included updating div tags to semantic elements, adding descriptive text to the title and image alt tags, as well as fixing broken links. The result is a webpage that is both easier to work on as a developer and better optimized for search engines.
